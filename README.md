## About the Project

The project started with the motivation of learning python. After learning the basics with a course (100 days of code from Udemy) i wanted to program something that looks good and interests me. 

I decided to continue with graphical user interfaces (customTkinter) and automation. Thus the idea of the Tinderbot was born. 

Since I am a beginner, I decided to implement it without Selenium and classes (PyAutoGui instead). In the next version I will implement it with Selenium and classes (and more functions).
## Built with

- [**Python**](https://www.python.org)

- [**CustomTkinter**](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter)

- [**PyAutoGui**](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI)



## Getting Started

- Environment running python 3.x
- Installation of the required packages (CustomTkinter and PyAutoGui)
- Tinder Account with login enabled

```bash
  Go to https://tinder.com
  Login to your Account
  Allow location request
  Start the Bot
  Click "Start(100x) or "Start(125x)"
  Wait for 15 Seconds
  See the magic happen :)
```

If 15 seconds is not enough, simply increase the number of seconds or use the version with 125 clicks to perform at least 100 automatic likes.
    
The bot was developed and tested for the following operating systems and browsers with the following screen resolutions:

- Operating system: Windows 11
- Browser: Chrome, Edge & Firefox
- Display resolutions: 1920 x 1080, 1600 x 900, 1440 x 900, 1366 x 768, 1280 x 720

If you are using one of the listed screen resolutions and a different operating system and/or browser, the bot could still work. However, if you use a screen resolution other than those listed, the bot will not work. I will implement the bot with Selenium in the next version and then take all operating systems/screen resolutions into account.
## Demonstration
